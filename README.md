### Base BootStrap Project

Additionally, if you like the layout of the website, I would recommend starting your project from the starter template below.

[Start Bootstrap - Bare](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/bare/)

[Bare](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/bare/) is a bare HTML starter template for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). This template features predefined file paths for Bootstrap and jQuery, so you can quickly create Bootstrap websites.
