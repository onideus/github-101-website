# GitHub Intro and Advanced Website

Congratulations on your interest in GitHub! I think you'll find it to be an extremely valuable tool 
to add to your repertoire. I hope that you've enjoyed the presentation and that you were able to gain 
some knowledge from the experience. Please feel free to fork this repository for your own use, or should
you think that there's something useful that can be added, make a Pull Request with the change instead!

This repository represents all of the associated files contained in the website found on the 
[GitHub 101 Tutorial](https://github.zach-martin.com) website.

### Course Requirements 

#### Suggested Software ####

* [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

#### OS Specific Notes ####
__MacOS__ - It's highly suggested that you follow the instructions on how to install homebrew on their system, to ease 
installation of software in the future, though there are multiple options in the git-scm installation page.  

__Windows__ -  Make sure that you opt to install git bash as part of the git-scm installation (it should be installed 
by default).  

__ChromeOS__ - It looks as though there is command-line functionality and git is already installed as part of the 
operating system when I created a virtual machine to try and explore using git from ChromeOS. However, I was unable to 
find a GitHub Desktop alternative in ChromeOS, so that portion of the session may not be as valuable for the students 
using this OS.

### Base BootStrap Project

Additionally, if you like the layout of the website, I would recommend starting your project from the starter template below.

[Start Bootstrap - Bare](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/bare/)

[Bare](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/bare/) is a bare HTML starter template for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). This template features predefined file paths for Bootstrap and jQuery, so you can quickly create Bootstrap websites.
